> story: Randomize the update order of critters and allow a seeded value (http://davidbau.com/encode/seedrandom.js)
story: Zoe rotates left 90 degrees at each step
story: Rob and Zoe can starve to death/creature dies after 10 ticks
       Given that Rob starts at 0,0
       And there are no resources in the world
       And Rob moves up one each tick
       Then Rob should die after 10 seconds
story: render a resource as a filled box in the grid
story: seed the world with 4 resources and 2 critters
story: stepping on a resource should remove it from the map
story: Rob can stay alive 20 ticks when it consumes a resource
       Given that Rob starts at 0,0
       And there is a resource at 0,1
       And Rob moves down one each tick
       Then Rob should die after 20 ticks
story: creature moves forward after rotating left
story: Rob can reproduce after moving
story: resources should not spawn on top of critters (or other resources)
